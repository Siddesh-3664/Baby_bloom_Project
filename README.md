# Baby_bloom_Project\

The theme of the project is to help the guardians of child or children, who are actually busy in their daily schedule.  It provides reminders to the parents to get vaccinated to their children. Any child born in the respective hospital will be registered in hospital’s dairy, so that a proper record is maintained for each and every child. This website helps the respective hospital to send a message and e-mail to the parents of every child up to certain age limit. The message or an e-mail consists of remainders of different vaccinations that must be given to a child within the limited period. By seeing this message the parents/guardians can remember the vaccination due date and also they visit the hospital with the child in-time.
